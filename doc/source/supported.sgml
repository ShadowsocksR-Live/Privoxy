 At present, <application>Privoxy</application> is known to run on
 Windows 95 and later versions (98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7 etc.),
 GNU/Linux (RedHat, SuSE, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Slackware and others),
 Mac OS X (10.4 and upwards on PPC and Intel processors),
 OS/2,
 Haiku,
 DragonFly, ElectroBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
 Solaris,
 and various other flavors of Unix.

<para>
 But any operating system that runs TCP/IP, can conceivably take advantage of
 <application>Privoxy</application> in a networked situation where
 <application>Privoxy</application> would run as a server on a LAN gateway.
 Then only the <quote>gateway</quote> needs to be running one of the above
 operating systems.

<para>
 Source code is freely available, so porting to other operating systems
 is always a possibility.
